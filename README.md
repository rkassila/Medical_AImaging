# Medical AIMaging

_A specialized deep learning solution designed for the detection of diseases in Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) images, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)._

## Project Overview

Trained on the Rad Image Net dataset, this tool is an exploration into medical diagnostics using deep learning. 
Medical AIMaging was our Le Wagon bootcamp project focused on detecting 36 diseases across 5 organs. 

---
### Built With

- **Tensorflow:** Leveraged as a foundational framework for developing and implementing advanced CNNs.

- **FastAPI:** Independently incorporated to optimize functionality and enhance overall application performance.

- **Streamlit:** Chosen for deployment, providing a user-friendly interface and facilitating a smooth deployment process.
  

### What's next?

We will try to work on an improved version. This first one having been only done in 10 days.
