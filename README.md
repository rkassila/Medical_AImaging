# Medical AImaging

_A deep learning solution designed for the detection of diseases in Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) images, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)._

## Project Overview

Trained on the [Rad Image Net dataset](https://www.radimagenet.com), this project is an exploration into medical diagnostics using deep learning. 
Medical AImaging was our Le Wagon bootcamp project focused on detecting 36 diseases across 5 organs.
